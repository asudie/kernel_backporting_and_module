# Q1 Code Review
Code review exercises are important because a significant amount of the Canonical kernel team's workload relies on
being able to do quick but thorough code review for patches and bugs submitted. A solid base in code review skills are not only beneficial to kernel maintenance but also kernel software development.

### 1. Explaination of the code

It seems to be an function that initialises a configuration structure for WILC1000 chipset.

1. We create a pointer to struct wilc_cfg_str_vals where we later will store values and iterator i.
2. Then allocate memory using kmemdup that not only allocates the memory but also puts the value of existing memory region there.
3. And we handle possible errors of allocation by freeing the memory. The fields are byte, half-word, word, string and values of the string.

### Errors

```c
+	if (!wl->cfg.s)
+		goto out_w;
+
+	str_vals = kzalloc(sizeof(str_vals), GFP_KERNEL); // str_val is only a pointer and we need memory for the structure
+	if (!str_vals)
+		goto out_s;
+
```

### Possible fix

To allocate the right amount of memory it should be sizeof(*str_vals)

> str_vals = kzalloc(sizeof(*str_vals), GFP_KERNEL);
